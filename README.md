Natural Language Processing - Sentiment Analysis on Hollywood movie reviews 

Goal: With Hollywood experiencing blockbuster successes and even bigger bombs, its critical to understand what makes a successful feature film, and what doesn't. Social media and alternative online platforms contain an extensive amount of text data which can reveal valuable insights. The goal is to use NLP sentiment analysis of these text data to find and classify the opinion of the core drivers responsible for a movie's success: the audience

Methodologies: Deep learning neural network VS traditional machine learning models in order to see which is better, how much better

Techniques: Neural Net, Fast.ai, Logistic Regression, Random forest, SVM and Voting

Model evaluation and validation techniques: prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and k fold cross validation

Input of the models: any English sentence or paragrah that is related to movie reviews, and the input can contain puncuation, slang and misspelled word
Output of the models: categorical outcome that classify the sentiment of the input as either positive or negative, with propobility of the prediction

Further application: the models can be easily fine-tuned in order to be applied in other areas such as facebook comments and twitter reviews
